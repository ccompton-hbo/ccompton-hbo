- 👋 Hi, I’m Cameron Compton (@ccompton-hbo), a member of the WBD (HBO Max) Product Design Team
- 👀 I’m interested in design, coffee, cycling, photography, being a good dad, and clean and organized processes that work **for** the people that use them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a good a parent.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with the UX Writing team on string management.
- 📫 How to reach me: WBD folks can look me up in the corp directories on Slack or email.
